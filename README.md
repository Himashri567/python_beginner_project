# python_beginner_project
The first few projects I created using python.
dice.py is a dice stimulator. With a single click of the button 3 dice roll simultaneously generating numbers from 1 to 6. Your score the total of the numbers on the three dice. If the numbers on 2 dice matches then you get a bonus of 2x on your total score. If the numbers on all 3 dice matches then you get a bonus of 3x on your total score. Play with your friends and find out who wins!
